Currently a work in progress
 
End goal is to program an AI to play tetris on a high level.
 
I chose to program this in Erlang as I found the topics of functional programming and distributed systems very interesting in my last semester of university, and this project is a fantastic excuse to learn and develop more in these areas.
 
The overall idea is to have the core loop of tetris run independently from the AI getting faster and faster, with the AI then having to adopt different strategies as it has less and less time to compute the best moves.
